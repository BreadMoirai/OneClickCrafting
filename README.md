# OneClickCrafting

This mod is clientside only.
After selecting a recipe in the recipe book, the client will shift-click the crafted 
item from the result slot into your inventory.

- Clicking a recipe will craft 1 of that item.  
  - This can be limited to only left click or only right click
- Shift-clicking a recipe will craft 1 stack of that item.
- Holding the drop key and clicking a recipe will craft 1 of that item and drop it.  
- Holding the drop key, Shift, and clicking on a recipe will drop a stack's worth of crafts.

### Keybinds

  - Holding this key will enable or disable the mod functionality
  - If `Always On` is `True`, holding this key will disable the mod and vice versa.
